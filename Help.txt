create new folder using mkdir "folder_name"
cd to "folder_name"
create file using touch command (one js file for server and rest all the file you need for the project)

npm init (to setting up the project this will gives you a json file where we can see the dependencies about the project)
// npm install express
// npm install body-parser (if needeed)


use node "file_name" to run js file in terminal
use nodemon "file_name" to run server file so that it will update and restart the server automatically
use ctrl + c to close the server or anythng you want to take the exit



/* IN THE SERVER FILE */

const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended : true}));

/* here we used to write the app.get and app.post methods */

app.listen(8000 , function(){
    console.log("Server Started.);
});
